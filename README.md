Program Guild Wars Launcher is a tool that runs your GW client using command line from Windows with special command "-lodfull" 
which boost a little bit graffic of the game by disabling low quality models that where used in the past to prevent fps drop on slower computers.

To make it work, all you have to do is to use it instead of runing GW client directly and check if your GW client is installed in the following directory:
C:\Program Files (x86)\ with the name of .exe file Gw.exe

Unfortunately it doesn't have much use since 8th may 2018 update because it could be done via game settings.
